# 🚀 FalconEye – Prompt-Guided Intelligent Tracking Rover

FalconEye is a **product-oriented intelligent tracking system** designed for **real-time, robust object following** in dynamic environments.  
It enables users to specify a target using **clicks, reference images, or natural language**, and autonomously tracks and follows the target using a **vision–language perception pipeline**, **distractor-aware tracking**, and **closed-loop motion control** on edge hardware.

The system is optimized for **performance, deployability, and practical usability**, making it suitable for real-world robotics applications such as:

- Human-following robots  
- Mobile surveillance  
- Assistive robotics  
- Smart delivery & service robots  
- Autonomous companions

## 🧠 System Overview

FalconEye converts **user intent** into **persistent target tracking** using the following pipeline:

1. **User Prompt (Base Station)**  
   Click / Image / Text input  

2. **Object Segmentation**  
   - SAM for spatial clicks  
   - CLIPSeg for image/text prompts  

3. **Bounding Box Initialization**  
   Mask → Bounding box  

4. **Visual Tracking**  
   DaSiamRPN maintains target identity  

5. **Decision Module (Python)**  
   Computes steering & speed  

6. **Motion Control (C++)**  
   Low-latency motor execution  

7. **Autonomous Rover Movement**

The system ensures the target stays **centered in view** and at a **safe distance** during motion.

## 🏗️ Architecture

FalconEye uses a **distributed architecture**:

### Base Station (Laptop)
- User interface  
- Prompt input (Click / Image / Text)  
- Target specification  

### Onboard Rover (Jetson AGX Xavier)
